# Class 06 Reading Notes
* Understanding problem domain is the hardest part of programming. 
* Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. 
* The document object model specifies how browsers should create a model of an html page and how javascript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. The dom can be referred to as an api. User interfaces let humans interact with programs, apiâ€™s let programs and scripts talk to each other. Dom has four main types of nodes. The document node, the element node, the attribute node, and text nodes. To access and update the dom, there are two steps. Step 1, access the elements. Step 2, work with those elements. Methods that find elements in the dom are called dom queries. Array syntax is preferred for selection an element from he node list because it is faster. Css selectors can be used with jquery. Use a for loop to repeat actions for an entire node list. Different browsers treat white space differently, some as nodes and some not. Dom manipulation offers another technique to add new contentto a page (rather than innerhtml). It involves three steps. Step 1, create the element. Step 2, give it content. Step 3, add it to the dom.
