# Reading Notes for Class 08
* Boxes can be nested in css, and those are called containing elements. Css treats each html element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block level box or an inline box. There is normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning, fixed positioning, and floating elements. In normal flow, each box level element sits on top of the next one. In relative positioning, it moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow. Absolute positioning, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page. Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed. It positions the element in relation to the browser window. When a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place. Z index allows overlapping boxes to become see through. Float moves a box to one side of the page. Float can be used to place elements side by side. To fix borders on only an element containing only floated items, the overflow property can be set to auto, and a width can be given. Fixed with layouts and liquid layouts are two different ways of designing, one stretches to the size of the screen and one does not. Grid layouts can also be to organize things in a page.
