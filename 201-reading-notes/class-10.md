# Reading Notes for Class 10
* Common problems when writing JavaScript include order of execution, execution contexts. Order of execution can make problems when you run a function that uses another function, but that function isn’t declared until later in the script. Execution contexts correspond to variable scope. JavaScript uses the stack when it needs data from another line of code. Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases of activity. First, prepare, then, execute. Functions in JavaScript are said to have lexical scope. They are linked to the object they were defined within. So, for each execution context, the scope is the current execution context’s variables object plus the variables object for each parent execution context. Error objects show up in the console, and help you pinpoint where you have made a mistake. Console logging is also a good way of tracking the flow of things in your script. Breakpoints can help you see where things are not going as planned in your code. Try, catch, and finally are good things to use if you know that your code will not work.
