# Class 13 Reading Notes
* Native client applications have held an advantage over web applications.. the operating system typically provides an abstraction layer for storing and retrieving supplication-specific data like preferences or runtime state. These values may be stored in the registry, ini files, xml files, or some other place according to platform convention. If your native client application needs local storage beyond key value pairs, you can embed your own database, invent your own file format, or any number of solutions. 
* Microsoft first came up with a way to store data with internet explorer, and then flash, and then amass, and then gears. Each type of storage is specific to a single browser, or reliant on a third party plugin. Html 5 solved that problem. To trap storage, itâ€™s the same as any other event. You add an event listener. 5 megabytes is the storage each origin gets by default. Data is always stored as a string. When data is retrieved, it must be coerced to the desired datatype.
