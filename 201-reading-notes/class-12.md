# Class 12 Reading Notes
* The canvas element allows you to draw in your website. It can be selected just like any other html element. It can be styled just like any other image. The canvas element needs a closing tag. To render canvas, you need to specify the dimensions by the getcontext() method. To fill a space in canvas, a coordinate system must be used. The coordinates are relative to 0,0. fillRect(), clearRect(), and strokeRect() are all functions for drawing. You can draw all kinds of stuff in the canvas, such as pacman or hearts or chat bubbles, or other things like that. Colors and style can be added to drawings. Fillstyle and strokestyle are 2 different methods that add colors. Fillstyle adds color when filling shapes, and strokestyle adds color for shapes outlines. If you put a drawing in a for loop, you can make a drawing of a color palette. Rgba values can be plugged in as well, and global alpha makes everything as transparent as you want. Linecaps change how the end of a line is presented. They can be square or round. Round, bevel, and miter are all ways converging lines can be connected. Text can be edited in the drawing box as well.
