* Height and width are css parameters that can control image size. Margin is also used so that text does not touch the image. Repeat shows the image repeated both vertically and horizontally. Repeat-x only repeats horizontally. Repeat-y only repeats vertically. No-repeat, the image is shown only once. Scroll, the background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page. A sprite is when a single image is used for several different parts of an image. Sprites make web pages load faster. 
* Search engine optimization is where you try and get your site to appear nearer to the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.
