# Reading Notes for Class 07
* A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports,, tv schedules, and sports results. The <table> element is used to create a table. <tr> is used to indicate the start of each row. <td> is used to show the data in each cell. <th> represents the heading for a column or row. <th scope=”row” or “col”> indicates whether a heading is for a column or a row. Row span and column span allow table data to span one or more rows or columns. 
* New objects can be created with the new Object() function. Multiple new objects can be created at the same time with constructor notation. Create the object, then add properties and methods. Literal notation and object constructor notation are both ways to create an object with properties and methods. The this keyword describes a value in this object, being whichever object youre currently in. arrays actually are objects, but they are a special kind of object. You can combine arrays and objects to create complex data structures. Arrays can store a series of objects, and remember their order. Objects can also hold arrays, as values of their properties.
