# Class 03 Reading Notes
* A file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. Files on most modern computer systems are made up of a header, data, and end of file character. The file extension denotes what format the data is stored in. gif files are stored in a different format than a text file for example. You must give the computer a path to access a file. A good way to open files in python is: with file as varname: do more processing. This will automatically close the file when that code block is done running. 
* A syntax error is where you write incorrect syntax in your code, and an exception error is where you write syntactically correct code but it still results in an error, something like dividing by zero. Raise can be used to throw an exception under certain conditions, like if an argument needs to be a number within a range, but the given number exceeded the range. Try and except blocks are a way of utilizing exceptions without crashing the program. Finally will always run even if there were errors caught in the except statement.
