# Reading Notes for Class 43
I think that the google article about autonomous weapons systems is about half right. On the one hand, having autonomous weapons systems is a dangerous wildcard and could result in large scale loss of life. on the other hand, what if another world power developed autonomous weapons systems and used them against us or others? That would also result in large scale loss of life most likely. However ugly and undesirable Mutually Assured Destruction is, it has resulted in a world with less conflict and more stability than in the past. Whether that trend will continue is up for debate, but I donâ€™t think that autonomous weapons systems are necessarily a bad thing. The general idea being someone else will build an autonomous system and use it on others, potentially us, and we should be able to match capabilities. But I do agree with the sentiment of the article, that autonomous weapons systems could be incredibly dangerous and we should be acutely aware of the dangers.
