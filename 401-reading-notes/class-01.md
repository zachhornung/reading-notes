# Class 01 Reading Notes
* Pain is a part of intense learning, but it is not suffering. Suffering is pain without purpose. It is not to be confused with pain.
* Big O notation is how the performance or complexity of an algorithm is described.
* O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time or space regardless of the size of the input data set.
* O(N) describes an algorithm that will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the data set.
* O(N^2) describes an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the dataset.
* O(2^N) describes an algorithm whose growth doubles every time an item is added to the size of the data set.
* O(log N) describes an algorithm that iteratively halves data sets, such as a binary search.
