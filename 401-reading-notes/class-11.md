# Reading Notes for Class 11
* Jupyter labs allows you to import all kinds of data and manipulate it in a jupyter notebook. You can load code in cells and run cells when you want to. You can run multiple different languages in a jupyter notebook, including python and markdown. The indicator to the left of each cell tells you the order a cell was ran in. one notebook runs on the same kernel, so the cells are al linked.
* Numpy is a commonly used python data analysis package. Numpy allows you to interact with other python packages that use numpy under the hood. Numpy arrays are quite similar to regular python lists, but they are much faster. Numpy supports different data types like floats, ints, and strings. Numpy arrays can be either modified in place or a new array can be returned wit the specified operation applied to each element in it. Arrays can also be added together, multiplied together, divided, pretty much any operation an be done one multiple arrays as long as they are compatible shapes. Subsetting arrays can be very handy, its just pulling data where a condition is true. Transpose is the operation that is used for reshaping arrays.
