# Class 02 Reading Notes
* Test driven development strategy means to write tests first. Test files should test all the functionality of the code. The structure of the tests should mirror the code, except for with test_ in front of the name of the file. A widely used convention is AAA, Arrange, Act, Assert. The Cycle is a good convention for writing code. First, write a test and make sure it fails. Then write the feature and make it pass the test. Then refactor the feature code so that it is beautiful. 
* Recursion is the process by which a function calls itself either directly or indirectly. Certain problems, such as towers of Hanoi, can be solved easily with recursion. Recursive functions need a base condition to resolve. With recursion, the computer is waiting on the value returned from the base case to resolve  the values higher up in the stack. It is very important to have a base case. Iteration is usually faster than recursion, but recursion usually looks cleaner, and some problems like tree traversal are inherently recursive.
