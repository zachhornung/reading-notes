# Reading Notes for Class 12
* Pandas can take numpy arrays and make them have more detailed information, and different types of data in each column. Pd.dataframe(arr) will make a dataframe. A dataframe can also be converted into a numpy array. Pandas allows you to take whichever cross section of the data you want. Functions can be applied to particular parts of the data, pretty much anything you want tot do can be done.
