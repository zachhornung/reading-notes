# Reading Notes for Class 10
* A stack is a data structure that consists of nodes. Each node references the next node in the stack, but not the previous. Common terminology for a stack is

Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
Top - This is the top of the stack.
Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

FILO means that if a node is the first in then it’s the last out. LIFO is if a node is the last in then it’s the first out. 
queues are basically the opposite of stacks. A queue works on FIFO, first in first out, and LILO, last in last out.
