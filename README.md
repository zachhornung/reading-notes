### Growth Mindset
How to stay in a growth mindset
* Don't be discouraged by challenges, they are opportunities for ~~failure~~ **growth**
* Criticism is a good thing, it helps identify areas of improvement and opportunities to learn
* The success of others is something to be celebrated, if someone else did something then it shows that you can also. As said by Jim Parsons, 
> Someone else's success is not your failure.
