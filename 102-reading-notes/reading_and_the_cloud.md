Version control allows you to revisit different versions of a file by recording changes. Local versions are on your hard drive, centralized versions are on one centralized server. Distributed version control has mirrored copies on various servers to minimize lost data in case of a failure.
•	Committed- data is stored securely in a local database
•	Modified- changes have been changed but not committed to the database
•	Staged- flagged a files changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
Tracked images can be modified, unmodified, or staged. They were part of the last snapshot. Untracked images wer enot part of the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area. 
Git status tells you where the file resides in the life cycle of the file. Git add makes a file tracked and staged for committing. Git commit takes a snapshot of the file to the working directory. Pushing puts the file into a remote repository.
