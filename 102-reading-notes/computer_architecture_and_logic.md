# Computer Architecture and Logic
- Computers manipulate information. Computers need to take inputs, store information, process the information, and then output results. All computers have this in common. Computers use electrical components to represent on and off switches, or true and false. One bit is the mallest piece of information a computer can store. The binary number system you multiply by 2 each time, increasing by double each time you move left. Text is represented in binary with a sequence of numbers. Colors are represented by numbers as well, and each pixel carries a value that is associated with a particular color. The sum of the pixels makes the image, and multiple images in sequence makes video. Sound is represented by wave forms on a graph, and any point along the graph can be represented with numbers. Circuits manipulate information to give you different results. These are logic gates, and logic gates are put together in circuits. Software is what runs on the hardware of the computer. Software and hardware interact with each other thru the cpu. The cpu converts software languages into bianary. The operating system controls hardware and software.  The only thing that makes computers smart is the individual using them.
