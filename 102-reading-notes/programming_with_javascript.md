# Programming With JavaScript
- You can use javascript to access any element, attribute, or text from an html page. Javascript allows you to modify web page content in real time. Javascript can be used to show slideshows, forms, reload part of a page, filter data, among other things. A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow to achieve a goal. They are like recipes for the computer. A script can be a one simple task, or a complicated set of tasks with which the computer can preform one of more given an event. Writing out a flow chart can make longer sets of instructions easier to keep track of and manage. Breaking code into tasks and then steps helps to keep things organized. Computers need to be told very detailed, step by step instructions (programmatically).
- An expression evaluates into a single value. Expressions rely on operators. Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. Arithmetic operators follow PEMDAS. String operators only use the addition sign, and add two strings together. 
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to preform a specific task. It allows you to reuse the function rather than repeating the same set of statements. First you define a function using the function keyword, then you call it using the function name. functions can get the values of variables, and arguments can be values.
