# The Coders Computer
A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text. There are many different kinds, and it is a personal choice as to which one works for you. There are a couple important features of text editors. They are code completion, syntax highlighting, a nice variety of themes, the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions when you need them. 
Code completion suggests code to you based on what you’ve typed so far. It helps to avoid errors in typing. Syntax highlighting highlights important parts of the text, which makes identifying them easier. Different things are colored differently for easier recognition and differentiation. Themes help with  things like eye strain by making background and text colors changeable. Extensions are what allows your text editor to grow as your skills grow. They allow you to add more features to your text editor.
A command line is a text based interface to the computer. Commands are typically written first, then command line arguments. Commands are typically abbreviations of words describing what you want to do. In the file directory, absolute paths refer to file location with respect to the root, and relative paths indicate where we are currently in the system. ~ is a shortcut to the home directory, . is a reference to your current directory, and .. is a reference to the parent directory.

* (Pwd) shows you where you’re at currently
* (Ls) lists the contents of a directory
* (cd) change directory
* (~) shortcut to home directory
* (.) reference to current directory
* (..) reference to parent directory
* (file) obtain information on what type of file a file is
* (ls -a) lists the content of a directory including hidden files

Everything is actually a file. Linux is case sensitive. Quotes and escape characters help to identify a single command line argument instead of more than one.
