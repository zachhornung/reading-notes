# Markdown
Markdown is a way to make a web page. Markdown is basically just regular text but with some other symbols to tell the computer how something should be formatted. The different symbols and how they are used is called syntax. For example, to make a header in a markdown, you just type # and then whatever you want the header to be. The more #### you have, the smaller the heading. If I wanted to make text italic, I would type: *text*. Two star signs make text bold, like this **text**. Links in Markdown are easy also. The text you want to be able to click on goes first, in brackets, and then the link goes right next to it with no spaces in parenthesis if I wanted to the word “google” to be a link to the website google, I would do this: [google](https://google.com).
# Github Pages
