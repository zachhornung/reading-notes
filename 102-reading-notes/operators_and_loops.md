# Operators and Loops
- Comparing a value to another value is called a Boolean, it will return either true of false.  ‘==’ stands for is equal to, ‘===’ stands for strict equal to, ‘!=’ stands for is not equal to, ‘!==’ stands for strict not equal to, ‘> ‘ stands for greater than, ‘>=’ stands for greater than or equal to, ‘<’ stands for less than, ‘<=’ stands for less than or equal to. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator. ‘&&’ stands for logical and, ‘||’ stands for logical or, ‘!’ stands for logical not. 
- Loops check a condition. If it returns true, the code will run until it returns false. You create a variable, usually called ‘I’, set a condition on it, and then update the variable to do something. A while loop runs for as long as the condition in the parenthesis is true.
