* Its important to keep mobile views in mind, because so many people are viewing the internet with their phones. Responsive web design is the practice of building a website that works on every size screen, including both mobile and desktop. Responsive web design is where the page reacts quickly and positively to any change. Adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation. Responsive web design is the most popular right now. Media queries are used to change properties when a certain condition is met. There are lots of conditions that can be set for media queries. Meta tags can be used to get a deviceâ€™s screen size. 
* Floats move boxes to particular parts of the screen, and then allow other elements to flow around them. Floats are generally less powerful than grid or flexbox, but they still have properties unique to them. Clearing floats is important, and the empty div method, overflow method, and easy clearing method all work to clear floats.
