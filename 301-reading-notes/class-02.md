# Class 02 Reading Notes
* Jquery allows you to traverse the dom much easier than using normal javascript. It can select elements, perform tasks, and handle events. Jquery has been used on over a quarter of all websites, because it makes coding easier. Queries motto is write less, do more, because it allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write with plain javascript. There are lots of ways to find an element with jquery. Just specifying an element will return its contents, and specifying something will add whatever you specified as text content. You can chain jquery selections, and loop them to trigger different css options. Event handlers can also be added with jquery, and information about the event can be returned.
* Pair programming is a great idea because you can get feedback right away, and make less errors in your code in the process. Pair programming involves a driver and a navigator. The navigator does high level tasks and the driver does low level tasks. Pair programming increases efficiency, is more engaging, allows you to learn from fellow students, allows you to practice social skills, allows you to practice for job interviews, and in general readies you for the workplace.
