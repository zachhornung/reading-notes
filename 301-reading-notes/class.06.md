# Reading Notes for Class 06
* Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. That means that it is a JavaScript runtime. It allows you to use all the modern features of JavaScript. NPM is the JavaScript package manager. It allows you to install packages. The node modules folder is where all of the dependencies for your project are located. The dependencies are other libraries of JavaScript code. Node.js allows us to run JavaScript on the server also. Node.js is single-threaded, and event-driven. That means that everything that happens in node is a reaction to an event. Node uses the libuv library to implement asynchronous behavior. It allows the server to work much faster. Node uses the http module to access the http function, which is then passed a request and a response. Node speaks json, which means that you can write everything in JavaScript.
