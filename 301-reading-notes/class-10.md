# Reading Notes for Class 10
* A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions. It marks what functions are in a function, and what the current line is, and which functions are resolved. A function is resolved when any functions inside have been run. The call stack is a data structure that uses the last in, first out principle. The stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed, and will remove it after execution. This is what makes code in JavaScript synchronous. A stack overflow happens when there is a recursive function with no exit point. Adding debugger into your code is a great way to see what in your code is getting executed and where in the call stack things are.
