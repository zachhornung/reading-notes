# Class 14 Reading Notes
* Database normalization is a process that is used to organize a database into tables and columns. A table should only be about a specific topic. Normalizing data reduces the amount of duplicates in the database. There are three main reasons for normalizing a database. Minimizing duplicate data, minimize or avoid data modification issues, and to simplify queries. Duplicate information has 2 problems, decreased performance and difficult to maintain data changes. First normal form is where information stored in a relational with each column containing atomic values. Second normal form is where a table is in first normal form and all of the columns depend on the primary key. Third normal form is where a table is in second normal form and its columns are not transitively dependent on the tables primary key.
