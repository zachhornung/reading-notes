# Reading Notes for Class 13
* When a form is submitted, the form is making a http request to the server. The form action tells you where to go when the form is submitted, and the method tells you what youre going to be doing when you get there. The get method tells the server that it wants a body of information back on response. It sends the information in an object with key value pairs, and it also puts the key value pairs in the url. When using the post method, the key value pairs donâ€™t go into the url, they get put into the request body. All languages can look at http requests,  ht they have different syntax and libraries for doing it. Forms have lots of different things for getting users to put in data and when they press the submit button, theyre really making an http request.
