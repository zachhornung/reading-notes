# Class 05 Reading Notes
*Heroku is a place where you can deploy your code. If you have a github repository on your computer, you can push it up to Heroku instead of github, and it will deploy and be able to be viewed. It will also give you logs to look at. You can view all of the information about the logs in the terminal.
